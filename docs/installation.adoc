= How to install


There are two releases:

. the google store version which does not work on chrome:// pages (due to chrome store limitation)
. the zip version which works on chrome:// pages



== Google store version

// TODO(hbt) create google store branch + remove chrome:// + create release and link zip here

No google store version available. Mainly because most contributors are from github and google store version is more likely to generate support requests and reach the wrong audience. 
It also requires additional branding + review to prevent confusion with cVim. 

== ZIP version

. Download latest from https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/releases
. turn on flag `chrome://flags/#extensions-on-chrome-urls`
. restart browser
. load unpacked extension 
. should work on every tab except `view-source`

NOTE: You can disable the yellow bar warning when starting chrome using `--disable-infobars`

NOTE: On Vivaldi, a different flag is used. Check https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/issues/73
